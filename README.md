## Current Challenges and Proposed Solutions
- **C1:** Vehicles are not where they are supposed to be at pickup
- **C2:** Vehicles are dirty or need maintenance when they are picked up for use by customers
- **C3:** Vahicles are not fully charged at pickup
- **C4:** Customers are not relying on the service for regular travel

## Architecture Decision Records
- [Infrastructure Hosting](adr/ADR-Cloud.md)
- [Application Architecture: Monolith or Microservices?](adr/ADR-Monolith.md)
- [AI: Which Platform or Framework to use for Building Agents?](adr/ADR-AI-Agent.md)
- [Analytics: Tooling for the Data Pipeline](adr/ADR-Data-Pipeline.md)

## Assumptions
- Tesla
- Purpose-built scooters and bicycles
- GPS connectivity
- At-worst intermittent cellular connectivity

## AI Enablement
- Pricing Algorithm
- Predictive inventory usage
- Return and damage analysis

## Parking Lot / Ideas for the Future
Some ideas we discussed were discarded for now because of time constraints or 
outside forces such as regulations. This section very briefly covers those ideas so they are
not lost as the company grows and the legal and regulatory environment changes.

- Use of autonomous vehicles for inventory management
- Loss prevention
- Criminal usage detection
